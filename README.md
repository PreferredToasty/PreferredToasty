|(body) Hello! My name is PreferredToasty (you can just call me toasty). I'm a beginner developer in the C# object-oriented workspace. |
|Im interested in making video games using Unity. I made this account to share the progress that i make on my journey to making games, |
|and to help my channel reach more eyes. So if you wouldn't mind, please check out my socials at the beginning of this file (you can   |
|copy and paste the links into your internet browser). Thank you! (/body)                                                              |
